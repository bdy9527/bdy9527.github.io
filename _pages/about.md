I am a fourth-year PhD student in the School of Computer Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), advised by  Prof. [Chuan Shi](http://shichuan.org/).
I also collaborated with Prof. [Xiao Wang](https://wangxiaocs.github.io/), Beihang University.
Before that, I got my B.E in the School of Information and Telecommunication Engineering at BUPT.

I am interested in graph machine learning, especially spectral graph neural networks and graph signal proceesing.
Currently, I am working on applying the spectral information of graphs to various downstream tasks and applications.
