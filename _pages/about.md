I am currently a research fellow at National University of Singapore (NUS), collaborating with Prof. [Xinchao Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/sitexinchaowang/).
I obtained my doctoral degree in the School of Computer, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), supervised by Prof. [Chuan Shi](http://shichuan.org/).
I also collaborated with Prof. [Xiao Wang](https://wangxiaocs.github.io/) at Beihang University.
Before that, I got my B.E. in the School of Information and Telecommunication Engineering at BUPT.

I am interested in graph machine learning, especially spectral graph neural networks and graph signal processing.
